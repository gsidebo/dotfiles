- install zsh & prezto (if needed)
- move example files (might be a good idea to review the changes in case you've DLed a new version)
  - example_files/init.zsh into ~/.zprezto/
  - example_files/.zpreztorc to ~/.zpreztorc (~/.zpreztorc is a symlink)
- for machine-specific config, create .rcsettings
  - export a MYZSHRC variable pointing to local rc file path
- copy example_files/.zshrc to ~/.zshrc (or copy contents to bottom of file)
  - source GIT_USERNAME and GIT_TOKEN (if needed)
